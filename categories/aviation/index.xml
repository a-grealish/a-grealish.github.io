      <description>Find the right school Sometimes there will only be one school within any reasonable distance from you, so you you have little choice. But, if you do have choice you may want to visit a number of schools and do a trial lesson. When visiting, you can answer any questions you have. I would recommend you ask about:&#xA;Costs Can they do a package deal for the minimum 45 hours Or, if you prefer can they accept a pay-as-you-go arrangement so that can can pay for each lesson when you can afford them What extra costs do they expect for ground school, equipment, landing fees, health checks &amp;hellip; Availability How many instructors do they have When are they most busy Does this align with your schedule Sustainability What aircraft do they use Can you do any training on an electric aircraft Can you supplement your training with simulator time Weather What does the typical year look like at this airfield In summer and in winter, what % of flight lessons get cancelled due to poor weather.</description>

      <description>What influences the carbon emissions? How much you fly? The standard UK PPL mandates a minimum 45 hours of flight time. Many students will complete their PPL within this minimum number of hours, but others will take more time. Clearly, the more hours you spend in the air, the more carbon emissions will be generated.&#xA;What you fly Most flight schools will use small, fairly fuel effecient aircraft. The Cessna 152 is a small 2 seater that is great to learn in.</description>
