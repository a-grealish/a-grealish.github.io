<p><img src="/img/airfield.jpg" alt="Airfield"></p>
<p>Sometimes there will only be one school within any reasonable distance from you, so you you have little choice. But, if you do have choice you may want to visit a number of schools and do a trial lesson. When visiting, you can answer any questions you have. I would recommend you ask about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs
<ul>
<li>Can they do a package deal for the minimum 45 hours</li>
<li>Or, if you prefer can they accept a pay-as-you-go arrangement so that can can pay for each lesson when you can afford them</li>
<li>What extra costs do they expect for ground school, equipment, landing fees, health checks &hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Availability
<ul>
<li>How many instructors do they have</li>
<li>When are they most busy</li>
<li>Does this align with your schedule</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sustainability
<ul>
<li>What aircraft do they use</li>
<li>Can you do any training on an electric aircraft</li>
<li>Can you supplement your training with simulator time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Weather
<ul>
<li>What does the typical year look like at this airfield</li>
<li>In summer and in winter, what % of flight lessons get cancelled due to poor weather.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can you speak with a current or former student?</li>
</ul>
<p>Asking these questions will ensure you find the right school for you. Finding a school that matches your needs is the most impactful thing you can do to get the most from your PPL. But once you&rsquo;ve found the right school, there is more you can do.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-for-your-lessons">Preparing for your lessons</h2>
<h3 id="making-notes">Making Notes</h3>
<p><img src="/img/pilot-notes.jpg" alt="note taking"></p>
<p>During and after each lesson, remember to take notes on what you&rsquo;ve learnt. I personally like to do this in the Airfield cafe after my flight, I take my time to reflect on the flight and make notes on what I&rsquo;ve learnt. I do this in a digital note-taking tool such at Notion or Evernote. This can be just as impactful in a handwritten notebook, the important part is the reflection and note-taking.</p>
<h3 id="recording-your-lessons">Recording your lessons</h3>
<p><img src="/img/cessna-pilots.jpg" alt="recording in cockpit"></p>
<p>Flight lessons can be long, so it can be difficult to remember everything that was covered. You can try to take notes as you are flying on a kneepad. But, you can also simply record your lessons and then watch them back to review. </p>
<p>Getting the correct setup can be difficult. I would recommend the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A GoPro (8 or later)</li>
<li>A suction mount - this is important so that you can position it to cover both the cockpit and the exterior view</li>
<li>A audio adapter - I struggled to master the radio comms element of my flight training. Using this adaptor with a GoPro allows you to capture the radio audio in your recording</li>
</ul>
<p>The above setup will cost around £500 new, but could be much cheaper and sustianable if you buy these used. This seems like a large upfront costs, but it&rsquo;s only around 5% of the full cost of a PPL. Investing early will make you learn more quickly and get the most from your lessons.</p>
